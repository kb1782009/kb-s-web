        <h1>My LOVE. My CATS</h1>
        <p> i have a whole history that i remeber about my cats. so let's go in the 2013 where it all begin. in a raining night, my father was gone to a far place from our house to bring me a surprise. when i was sleeping in my bed, i felt like there is a animal walking on me ,and when i opened my eyes, it was a cute little furry white cat who wants to sleep on me. i just love it tat i hugged the cat ,making her uncomfurtable . she got angry and meowed loudly . my mum and pa(father) come and saw that i have a cat in my hands. i asked my father 'what is her name'and he said 'maxie'. she was my 1st cat,after 1 month he bought a brown cat named'bruno'. all my other cats are their child but sadly in 2016 maxie died . but i have a whole cat army of 19 cats. bruno is still in a big shock and eat 1out of 3 time a day. he still cry and some times i also cry with him. then their kids coki,coco,rosy,pinki and my loving daimond.daimond died after maxie. i was harte-broken to hear that. my fater said that he is in hospital and when i asked to visit him, my mum told me that he is that. i got to know that in evening and he died in morning. i was just like ,dead from inside,i never cried for continuous 2 hours. i fell sick frrom crying. but then coki gave birth to 4 kittens,tigger,energy,chiku and doru.energy and chiku died in 2020. and tigger give prince, douru and next time rex and cheta and coki gave birth to daimondina. prince gave gary,dragon and meru and tiger gave vanilla icecream. then recently gary my new loving gave mia and prince gave chhoutu,t rex,simba. my cat family.
